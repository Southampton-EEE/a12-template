# a12-template
LaTeX Template for the A12 Report

This is a LaTeX template for the A12 lab report. Effort has been made to match 
the University's specified template as closely as possible, though it's not 
perfect!

This template was developed on both [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/),
and on a full TeX Live installation. MiKTeX on Windows is currently untested,
though as I understand, you may have to install some extra packages.

If compiling from the command line, you'll need to run the following:

```
pdflatex template.tex
bibtex template
pdflatex template.tex
pdflatex template.tex
```
