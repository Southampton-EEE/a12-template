    This is the body of my abstract. It will tell you all about how excellent 
    my paper is! Please give me lots of money, since as is detailed herein, I 
    have a truly excellent patent opportunity. In reality, this is a template

\section{Introduction}

This text demonstrates how you might go about referencing items in the text. 
For example, you can find a table of my favourite elements in 
Table~\ref{tab:fav-elements}. There is also Figure~\ref{fig:hdd-crash}, which 
shows one of the many situations that can occur where you'll really wish you'd 
made a backup. Equation~\ref{eq:einstein} will teach you all about the true 
nature of matter, while Figure~\ref{fig:pid-loop} will conjure terrible 
memories of D1.

\section{Formatting Example}

You may wish to change your font at some point in your document to provide, 
for example: \textbf{bold text}, \textit{italic text}, or \emph{environment 
sensitive \emph{emphasized} text}. You might also like to include some code, 
like this: \texttt{printf("LAH-tekh not lay-teks");}.

In some cases, you might also like to have maths inline, say to provide a 
variable like $\phi_0$, or to include an expression like $3+4=7$.

This document has been setup to automatically generate IEEE references and 
citations. Most good online journals provide a \textsc{Bib}\TeX reference, 
which makes life very easy, simply copy the contents of the provided 
\texttt{.bib} file, and then make a reference with \verb|\cite{ref}|. The 
result is something like \cite{ref1}.

The remainder of the text in this document is total rubbish, so don't bother 
trying to read it! The source however will still be useful!
